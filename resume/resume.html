      <p>
	  Computers and the outdoors have always competed for my time. In high school I was the Computer club President and enjoyed tearing into hardware and upgrading chip sets, motherboards, hard drives, and power supply units as well as manipulating the software to make it all work. In science classes I really enjoyed studying plants and always had the thought in the back of my mind that plant-based genetics would uncover the cure for cancer.  When it came time to decide on a college and a path of study I pursued my plant based genetics interest and unfortunately found most time and energy in the program was spent on the agri-business component. I learned a lot and have no regrets, but I became disinterested in the topic and decided to pursue an education focusing on computers, which lead me to the Illinois Institute of Technology.
